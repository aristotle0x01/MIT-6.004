# MIT-6.004
**personal follow of mit 6.004 Computation Structures of spring 2017** 



### course address 

I used [edx: Computation Structures 1,2,3](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.004.1x_3+3T2016/home) as the main course content, because it was better organized and sliced into video, slides, problem sets with answer, as well as labs, than the original mit open course ware.



but sadly those contents will be removed from edx from 2021 Oct 15, so i downloaded all the course materials from edx, uploaded here

### lab address

I did not use labs from edx, but used [6.004 lab](https://computationstructures.org/exercises/cmos/lab.html) instead

![lab page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2216435/136508557-5ce2f7e6-bf6c-4e25-bcdb-d0739bafae49.png)



**<u>note:</u>**

be careful since all the lab content will only be saved in your browser cache, you can save it by "Save all answers" below, which will generate a file named **<u>"saved_state.json"</u>**, then upload it later to another browser

![save lab content](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2216435/136508804-c55ad80f-7f15-4f70-921c-711b48123122.png)



btw, you can do your lab design locally by running the simulation env locally, which can be downloaded from [6.004 tools & jade](https://github.com/6004x), then http://localhost:8000/jade_workbook.html, but the original /gates/and2, nor2...the like do not work, you have to substitute your own gates from lab2 /adder/and2, nor2...
